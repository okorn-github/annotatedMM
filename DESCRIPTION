Title: Annotated Matrix Market
Description: Embed annotations in Matrix Market file formats, such as row and
    column names. We call this format "Annotated" Matrix Market ("AMM") and it
    is backwards compatible with Matrix Market (albeit at the cost of losing
    the annotation support!). In future, support for custom annotation
    embedding may be supported.
